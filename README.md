# Webserv

Webserv is a lightweight HTTP web server written entirely in **C++**, without external libraries, developed as part of a Codam project in collaboration with @edooarda.  
It aims to implement core HTTP 1.1 functionality, handle multiple clients concurrently, and serve static as well as dynamic content through CGI.
